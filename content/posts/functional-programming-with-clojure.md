Now-a-days everyone has fantasy with functional programming. Obviously OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is ruling the world
for couple of decades leaving functional programming behind long ago. But now-a-days people are getting insterested in
functional programming. It's fun and also you can find new way of thinking how to solve a problem in programming. Clojure
is an awesome functional programming language. It's said that it is Lisp for JVM as it runs on top of JVM (Java Vertual Machine).
There is another amazing fact of Clojure, you have to write everything in Prefix basis.

```clojure
;; that means if you want to write (a + b) - (a + c)
;; what you have to write is:
- (+ a b) (+ a c)
```
